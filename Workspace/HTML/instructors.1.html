                <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                <p>My name is David Davies, but I liked to be called (Dai).
                I’m the managing director of I’LL DRIVE School of Motoring.I’m a father of one Boy,
                who lives with me.I was in the army for 22yrs, and I have driven lorries all over Europe
                and the UK, both experiences have helped me be the instructor I am today.In my spare time,
                I love to watch rugby, I am a season ticket holder for the Scarlets, so you will often find my
                there on Saturday afternoons, but also like watching any rugby game, so will sometimes go and watch my
                nephews play in Lougher.I have been a driving instructor since 2007, and I love my job, and I wouldn’t change it for the world, 
                I see every pupil as a different challenge, and with a very high first time pass rate, I must be doing something right.</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                    <p>My name is Sandra Jones and I along with Dai Davies are business partners of I'LL Drive School
                    Of Motoring.I am a nutty mother of 4 girls, so I am used to stressful situations and coping with 
                    stressed out teenagers. I have been a driving instructor since 2007 and have loved every minute of 
                    it. I think I got it from my Dad as he was a driving instructor in the Army for 7 years. I like to
                    have a laugh as well as having a serious side when I am teaching pupils, and putting pupils at ease
                    is my main priority. I believe that no 2 people are the same and I never push pupils into doing
                    anything I don't feel they are ready for, but I always encourage them, giving them the confidence 
                    and self belief in what they are doing. I also give 110% in my teaching.One of my main passions in
                    life is motorcycling and I am the owner of a Suzuki Bandit 600, and I try to take it for a spin
                    whenever I can so I can blow the cobwebs away, and at my age there are quite a few !!! I am also 
                    passionate about Welsh Rugby, 
                    so there are no lessons on International match days, so a word of warning, don't even try it</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                    <p>Hi I’m Martin and have recently joined Dai and his team at I’ll Drive.
                    I have been an instructor for over 11 years originally instructing in South 
                    East London which gave me a wealth of experience. I am thrilled to be working
                    with I’ll Drive. I’ve had a love of motoring for as long as I can remember and
                    passed both my motorbike and driving tests within a week of each other. In June 2014
                    I passed my Advanced Driving test with an entry to the I.A.M. first register 
                    (there are still times when I can’t believe how well I done). I have lived 
                    in Llanelli since 2007 having decided to return to my ancestral home of West 
                    Wales from Kent. I have 3 wonderful daughters, a beautiful wife, 2 cats and a
                    mad dog. My main interests after my family are photography and reading.
                    I’m not much of a sports fan but if Wales are playing rugby it will be on the radio
                    . I have a firm belief that learning to drive should be fun and that “laughter lubricates 
                    learning” but safety first at all times. Each pupil is an individual and will learn at 
                    their own pace but I will encourage each one to push themselves that extra bit to achieve that pass.</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                    <p>I'm Chris Gale and I'm the latest addition to the I'LL Drive School of Motoring family,
                    having joined in December 2011.So what can I say about myself? Well, I live in Ammanford
                    but I'm originally from West London where I moved from six years ago. I have been an ADI
                    for just over three years now, after spending over 20 years in the motor industry where
                    I have worked for many companies including Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Jaguar. Whilst working 
                    in the motor industry, I have been privileged to have driven some of the fastest cars on the 
                    planet on various track days, my last one being a Ferrari F360 at the famous Silverstone circuit in
                    January of this year. I have always had a passion for cars and driving which is why I love my job immensely.
                    Although teaching someone to drive is a serious business, I also like to have fun as well as I'm sure you'll 
                    find out!! When I'm not working I like to relax with my family, which is my wife, my eight month old daughter 
                    and my dog!!I'm a huge football fan and coming from West London, I have supported my beloved Chelsea for many years.
                    Apart from football, I enjoy playing the Playstation, music, films and a really good curry!!!! That's about it really, 
                    there are lots of things I could say......but I guess if you want to know more, you can ask me in person on your driving lessons!! </p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                    <p>My Name is Joanne, but have always been known as Jo.I am soon to be a mother of two boys,
                    my eldest son is 13yrs old and my other one i am currently pregnant with and due to have in 
                    early January 2014.I decided in a change of career and as i love driving myselfand being out
                    and about in the car i thought being a driving instructor was the perfect job, i qualified in
                    2008 and enjoyed teaching ever since, i am easy to get on with andalthough learning to drive 
                    has a serous side to it i thinkit should be a fun experience and a big step in gaining confidence 
                    and having your own independence.In my spare time i like spending it with my family and my fourdogs,
                    or getting my glad rags on and going out partying with my friends and having a dance.</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
                    <p>Hi there, my name is Nigel Jones and I have been a driving instructor since 2006,
                    previous to this I was a motorcycle instructor for 10 years. In 2014 I became the next
                    addition to the I'LL Drive family of instructors, for all my sins...lol I am a father 
                    of 2 sons so I have nerves of steel, which is needed in our profession. I am a full blooded
                    turk having lived in Llanelli all my life!!! I am a qualified mechanic which comes in handy
                    if any one breaks down lol I also hold a HGV Class 1 and PSV Class 1 licence. I love driving 
                    and have done so all over the world both professionally and for personal pleasure. I myself
                    have a passion bordering on an obsession with motorcycles and visit the Isle of Man every year, 
                    it keeps me sane lol. Just completed Lands End to John O'Groats accompanied by one of my sons. 
                    Can't say I love the feeling of the wind blowing through my hair, as it's illegal not to wear a 
                    helmet, but you know what I mean. Next on my bucket list is to tour Ireland on my Honda VT 750, 
                    think I might gather a few flying objects in my teeth for that one, as I will be smiling all the way.... 
                    I enjoy teaching and helping people go through the process of gaining a full licence. I do my best to
                    keep things as easy as possible no matter what age group I'm teaching. I am looking forward to the
                    future and I'm happy to be part of the I'LL Drive Team. </p>
